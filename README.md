The PMBC Project was initiated by a group of scientists, engineers, professors and entrepreneurs, aiming to enhance data analysis efficiency and accuracy for precision medicine. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the effective prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies of various diseases using cutting-edge bioinformatics, AI and blockchain technologies.

「Bioinformatics + AI + Blockchain」is undoubtedly a core technological combination to thoroughly solve the dilemma confronted by the precision medicine industry so far. With revolutionary commercial pattern and underlying technology, the program will make it possible for each institution on the chain to exchange data, develop, doing research collaboratively, and receive corresponding economic benefits。

PMBC platform builds a distributed storage structure (PMBC storage). Its infrastructure is founded on the cloud storage service and adopts the advanced encryption calculation so that all the data can be transmitted through the encrypted channel, with no need to worry about privacy disclosure.

The PMBC platform is designed for large data sharing and data analysis for precision medicine. It requires a reliable, secure, scalable and easily-maintainable applied system as a supporting pillar to guarantee its stable operation. 
PMBC is composed of the following layers：Core Layer, Base Layer, Dev Service Layer, Protocol Layer, AI Service Layer, and User Service Layer. The overview of the system architecture diagram is illustrated below:

Bioinformatics data analysis and precision medicine modeling is the pivot of the PMBC network. Precision Medicine DAPP providers can develop their DAPPs based on the data shared on the PMBC, and release the DAPP when its ready. Release note may include the information like the disease application, the requirement of data input and the cost of using the DAPP in terms of PMBC token. PMBC network will provide support for APIs that allow suppliers to connect their models and analysis algorithms to the PMBC networks. Users can take advantage of DAPPs of different diseases, make inquiries and provide feedback. PMBC values computing power and encourages all kinds of computing power nodes to join the chain. When a DAPP tries to acquire computing power for a certain task (e.g. model training), it will broadcast the request to the network, and each node will automatically detect whether it meets such request (e.g. memory, CPU, etc). If it meets the request, it can join the task and get the PMBC token as the reward.  

During the execution of tasks, PMBC will record the performance evaluation of each node. Performance metrics include but are not limited to network connection, computing capability, and number of errors occurred. Future optimization of selecting computing nodes can be based on these recorded metrics. Precision medicine DAPP providers will also be evaluated based on the user feedback and DAPP performance. DAPP performance in turn will benefit from user feedback and data accumulation. For example, a diagnostic DAPP’s model can be adaptively trained with the increase of the training samples. 

Data on PMBC will be privacy protected through multiple methods such as SHA-256 Secure Hash Algorithm, zero knowledge proof, differential privacy, and discrete storage. Furthermore, data Analysis will be protected via methods such as homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation. The identity of the user will be protected via pseudo anonymity and user authentication. Blockchain technology changes rapidly and the PMBC team will keep update with its development and update the strategy if needed.
